                        one of my projects. It is a website to show off my
                        projects and achievements so far and will be constantly
                        updated as I progress through my course. In developing
                        this website I have  utilised HTML, CSS and JavaScript to
                        handle everything from basic text and layout, making it look
                        pretty and animating things like the sidebar on the home
                        page!

                        June 2025 - During this month I undertook a job simulation
                        with Lloyds bank. One of my tasks was to redesign
                        their mortgage calculator into a new and improved version. I
                        took into account previous  feedback from users about
                        what was wrong with the old version and implemented new
                        improvements and features into my new version. For example
                        I created a pie chart to help visually display how the 
                        mortgage payments would be broken up. I used known formulas
                        to calculate the payments using things like interest rates,
                        down payments etc.
